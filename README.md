# Imblanced-Datasets-Boosting-Algorithms
The goal is to address imbalanced classification problems, one synthetic dataset, and two 'real-world' datasets (Iris and Credit Card) and apply one state-of-the-art machine learning method to solve it: XGBoost and compare it against Logistic Regression, SVM, GNB and RF.
